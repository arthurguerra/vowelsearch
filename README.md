# Vowel Search

## Problem

Given a stream, find the first vowel character v after a consonant, which is the predecessor of another vowel. Also, v
cannot be repeated in the stream. The end of the stream will be guaranteed by the `hasNext` method, which is going to
return `false` when the stream is over.
